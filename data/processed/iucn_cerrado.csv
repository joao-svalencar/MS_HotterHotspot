"Coleodactylus brachystoma","Least Concern",2021,"2014-08-04 00:00:00 UTC","São lagartos pequenos, diurnos e noturnos, sendo os maiores do gênero (Moretti 2009). Apresentam membros curtos e cauda menor que o corpo, forrageiam em meio ao folhiço. Utilizam como microhábitat cupinzeiros, troncos caídos, fendas de rochas e detritos do solo (Brandão and Motta 2005, Gonçalves 2012). Como método de defesa, expõe sua cauda sobre o corpo aos predadores, retirando a atenção de áreas vitais para sua sobrevivência, assemelhando-se a um escorpião (Brandão and Motta 2005). Seu padrão de coloração, junto ao seu comportamento e utilização do mesmo microhábitat servem de evidências para seu comportamento mímico a espécies de escorpiões ocorrentes na mesma área (Brandão and Motta 2005). Seus possíveis predadores incluem as espécies de pássaros <em>Penelope superciliaris</em>, <em>Crotophaga ani</em>, <em>Guira guira</em>, <em>Pitangus sulphuratus</em>, <em>Myiarchus </em>spp., <em>Tyrannus melancholicus</em> e<em> Cariama cristata</em> e lagartos maiores como <em>Mabuya nigropunctata</em>, <em>Ameiva ameiva</em>, <em>Cnemidophorus ocellifer</em> e <em>Tupinambis</em> spp (Brandão and Motta 2005).

Syntopic Leptodactylus species include L. furnarius, L. fuscus, L. labyrinthicus, and L. ocellatus. Males call under dense vegetation, from within underground chambers or exposed (Giaretta and Costa, 2007).<br/><br/>The reproductive season coincides with the rainy season (September-February). It is thought to reproduce like other members of the Leptodactylus fuscus group i.e. eggs laid in excavated ground chambers close to waterbodies. Clutch size is estimated to be ca 200 eggs (A.A.

"Rhinella veredas","Least Concern",2008,"2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC","Individuals of this species were found in open areas (cerrado, campo cerrado, veredas, and campo sujo). No reproductive activity was observed nor tadpoles found. However, in December toadlets were found close to wet areas, but no adults. Leptodactylus troglodytes, Pleurodema diplolistris, and Physalaemus centralis are found in the same habitats as R. veredas (Brandão et al., 2007). Individuals were observed in open areas during the rainy season, but were nowhere to be seen during the dry season. It is possible that they may burrow underground. The presence of some individuals with soil on their heads and developed calluses suggest that they may bury underground. R. veredas uses large temporary pools in the rainy season in the border area of the three states (R. Brandão, pers. comm. 2008).","The main threat in the region is the rapid conversion of land to monoculture of grain crops or trees (Pinus and Eucalyptus). The region is especially fragile due to its sandy soil, easily arable land and the lack of physical barriers for the mechanized treatment of soil, allowing for a rapid land use change. There are, however, populations of this species that are found within conservation areas (Parque Nacional Grande Sertão Veredas, Refúgio de Vida Silvestre Veredas do Oeste Baiano, Parque Estadual da Serra das Araras and another four private natural heritage reserves in the area of the three state borders, such as  São Francisco da Trijunção, Sertão do Formoso, Guará and Leite Verde) (R. Brandão, pers. comm. 2008).","It is an infrequently encountered species, seen mostly at the beginning of the rainy season (October/November) (Brandão et al., 2007).

"Lonchophylla dekeyseri","Endangered",2016,"2016-05-18 00:00:00 UTC","This bat lives in caves in dry forests associated with calcareous outcrops and appears to require caves to roost. In a study, population sizes changed throughout the year; the population of Dois Irmãos cave was larger in September and October, probably due to the recruitment of young, and in March and April, due to the return of pregnant females. In all populations the number of females exceeded that of males and the number of adults was greater than that of young. The species is closely associated with karstic environments (Aguiar <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Young individuals were captured from July to November and adults were captured throughout the year. <em>Lonchophylla dekeyseri </em>occurred in relatively small populations and demonstrated fidelity to the shelter, remaining for at least one year in the same cave (Aguiar <em>et al.</em> 2006). The reproductive pattern presented by the species was seasonal monoestry, with young being born in the dry season, probably due to the greater food availability at this time of the year. A nursery system seems to occur, as the females were never observed carrying their young (Aguiar <em>et al.</em> 2006). Females were found to occur in greater numbers than males, suggesting harem formation. Emergence from the shelter occurred in the first hours after dusk; returning just before dawn during the rainy season and returning around midnight and just before dawn during the dry season. The activity pattern observed was unimodal, changing to bimodal in the dry season. Activity period could be related to the blossoming and nectar production patterns of the flowers visited by <em>L. dekeyseri</em>.<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">It is a nectarivorous bat, but can use other resources such as fruits and insects.&#160;<em>Lonchophylla dekeyseri</em> feeds upon pollen in the dry season, when this resource is more plentiful, and consumes more insects and fruits in its diet during the rainy season, when nectar is scarce and insects are abundant. Bat hair analysis showed 7 types of pollen, mainly from <em>Pseudobombax </em>sp., <em>Bauhinia </em>sp. and <em>Lafoensia </em>sp.&#160;This species pollinates typical plants of the Cerrado.&#160;Bat-pollinated plants flowered during the dry season with sequencial peaks, probably a mechanism which may avoid competition for pollinators by other plants maximizing pollinator efficiency. The occurrence of more than one type of pollen in the same bat hair sample was common, indicating visits to several plant species during only one night (Coelho 1998).","The species distribution is patchy as cerrado habitat is severely and rapidly being degraded and destroyed.

The species is restricted to areas dominated by open grassland formations (campo limpo and campo sujo), generally developing over gently rolling, elevated table-tops (locally known as Chapadas) (C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2014). These habitats tend to occur in isolated tabletops with flat or gently rolling terrain.&#160;In Paraguay&#160;in this species has been found in a patch of well preserved Cerrado, in the highly deforested San Pedro Department (P.

Nogueira pers. comm.).","This species is endemic to the most heavily impacted and fragmented region of the Cerrado grassland and savanna region, the plateaus of the upper Paraná basin (C. Nogueira pers. comm.). It is likely to be impacted by habitat destruction throughout its range. Throughout its range, typical grassland habitats are extremely fragmented due to ongoing habitat loss, caused by the irreversible conversion of Cerrado grasslands for agriculture, grazing and human development (WWF 2007, C. Nogueira pers. comm.). Based on satellite data from the Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, it has been estimated that in 1998, only 18% of the original Cerrado habitat was available; this dwindled to only 16% in 2008 (C. Nogueira pers. comm.). An average habitat loss rate of 44% per ten-year period has been estimated (C. Nogueira pers. comm.), and rates of habitat loss are likely to have remained stable or accelerated in the decade since these figures were estimated. Since this species is a grassland specialist, these losses are even more acute. Grasslands are generally the first habitats to be converted, due to the lack of formal protection and the suitability for agricultural development.","This is a rarely-collected species known from a ""handful"" of specimens almost all from the Brazilian Cerrado (Smith <em>et al. </em>2014), and is thought to be genuinely rare. In Emas National Park in Goiás more than 500 snake specimens were sampled, with only three individuals of this species recorded. Intensive sampling in a Cerrado reserve in São Paulo state, where historical records are available (pre-1980), failed to record this species (Sawaya <em>et al.</em> 2008). A population decline is inferred based on extensive habitat loss throughout the range of this species (C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2014). This species occurs, or occurred historically, in one of the most heavily surveyed areas of Brazil and has been subjected to targeted searches (C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2019). While most workers expect that it will be rediscovered in parts of its historical range, C.

"Lycalopex vetulus","Near Threatened",2020,"2019-03-15 00:00:00 UTC","Hoary Foxes are typically found in open Cerrado, apparently preferring areas with sparse vegetation such as <em>campos limpos</em>, <em>campos sujos</em>, <em>campos cerrados</em> and cerrado <em>sensu stricto</em>&#160;(Cabrera and Yepes 1960, Coimbra-Filho 1966, Dalponte 1997, 2003, Silveira 1999, Juarez and&#160;Marinho-Filho 2002). Despite apparently avoiding swamp or flooded regions, it can be found in some open and dry lands in the Pantanal during the flooding period (Dalponte 2003). Censuses conducted in flooded lowlands of the Paraguay river did not record the species, neither in low continuous areas (Alho etal. 1988) nor in high, isolated areas (Schaller 1983, Dalponte 2003). There are records in human-modified areas such as pastures (Courtenay <em>et al</em>. 2006, Rocha <em>et al</em>. 2008, Dalponte 2009, Lemos, Facure <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lemos, Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011), agriculture (Juarez and&#160;Marinho-Filho 2002, Dalponte 2003, Lemos and&#160;Azevedo, obs. pes.) and silviculture, specifically in recent plantations of eucalyptus (Courtenay <em>et al</em>. 2006) and rubber (Lemos and&#160;Azevedo, pers. obs.). According to Dalponte (2003), cattle ranching areas (managed and in recomposition) represented 24.5% of Hoary Fox records by direct observation, while cultivated areas represented 7.5% of the records. In cattle farms in south-eastern Goiás, Lemos, Facure&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011) observed, via radio-telemetry, that Hoary Foxes utilized more pasture areas (especially trampled and overgrazed pastures) compared with other available habitats (pastures in some stage of succession, semi-deciduous vegetation and their edges, and swamps and their edges). There were no records in forest areas.<br/><br/>The Hoary Fox is an omnivore that uses termites as the basis of its diet in addition to beetles and grasshoppers, and depending on environment and season, wild and exotic fruits, small mammals, lizards, snakes, anurans and birds (Dalponte 1995, Dalponte 1997, Dalponte and&#160;Lima 1997, Juarez and&#160;Marinho-Filho 2002, Jácomo <em>et al</em>. 2004, Ferreira-Silva and&#160;Lima 2006, Trovati <em>et al</em>. 2006, Dalponte 2009, Lemos, Facure <em>et al</em>. 2011, Kotviski <em>et al</em>. in press). When it occurs in sympatry with the Crab-eating Fox and Maned Wolf (<em>Chrysocyon brachyurus</em>), there is some degree of interspecific dietary overlap (Jácomo <em>et al</em>. 2004; Kotviski <em>et al</em>. in press). However, the primarily termite-based diet of the Hoary Fox apparently allows it to coexist with other canids (Dalponte 2009, Kotwiski&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Some moderate diet overlap between <em>C. thous</em> and <em>L. vetulus</em> has been observed,&#160;although there were some differences in their preference for food items (Silveira 1999, Juarez and&#160;Marinho-Filho 2002, Lemos, Facure <em>et al</em>. 2011, Kotviski <em>et al</em>. in press). Jácomo and collaborators (2004) analysed the overlap in trophic niches among the three species at Emas National Park in Goiás and the largest overlap was between the Maned Wolf and the Hoary Fox. However, both species differed in their activity patterns, which allows them to co-exist sympatrically.<br/><br/>Hoary Foxes are considered solitary (Dalponte 2009) and monogamous, forming reproductive pairs during the breeding season and having offspring care (Dalponte 2003, Courtenay <em>et al</em>. 2006, Lemos, Facure <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lemos 2016). Direct observations report social interactions between the members of the familial group (male, female and season offspring), with more intense contact between males and females during the first four months of the offspring life. Females generate litters of one to five offspring (mean = 3, often born between July and August), with a gestation period of approximately 50 days (Dalponte 2003, Dalponte 2009, Lemos, Facure <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lemos and&#160;Azevedo, pers. obs.). Juvenile dispersal occurs between nine and ten months of age, when they begin to establish their own territories, which can be close to the area of their first months of life (Dalponte 2003, Lemos and&#160;Azevedo, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>There are few studies about home-range patterns. In Bahia, Juarez and&#160;Marinho-Filho (2002) estimated the home-range of an adult female at 3.8 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;while that of a juvenile male was 2 km<sup>2</sup>. Courtenay <em>et al</em>. (2006) followed a pair and two cubs in a human-modified area in Minas Gerais for a few months and estimated a family home-range of 4.56 km<sup>2</sup>. In Mato Grosso two pairs monitored for seven months had home-ranges of approximately 2 km² (Dalponte <em>et al.</em> 2018). In south-eastern Goiás, in human-modified areas of pasture in Cumari, Hoary Foxes (n = 12 males and eight females) monitored between 2008 and 2016 had an average home-range of 2.77 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Lemos 2016). Due to the low number of monitored populations (both in natural and human-modified areas) and the short duration of most studies, medium and long-term population studies are necessary.&#160;<br/><br/>Regarding interspecific interactions, there are very few studies about encounters between the Hoary Fox and other carnivores. From 2005 to 2016, in south-eastern Goiás, Lemos <em>et al</em>. (pers. obs.) witnessed at least six encounters between Hoary Foxes and Crab-eating Foxes/Maned Wolves, which generally resulted in the larger species chasing the smaller one (Lemos <em>et al</em>. 2007, Lemos 2016). Three records consisted of observations of Hoary Foxes monitored via radio-telemetry being expelled from their areas by monitored Crab-eating Foxes. Lemos, Facure&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(2011) also reports one male Hoary Fox with aggressive behaviour repelling a Maned Wolf from a den. There are very limited data with respect to predation by large carnivores, although Jácomo <em>et al</em>. (2004) registered Hoary Fox fur in Maned Wolf scats and R.C. de Paula (pers. obs.) and C. Bickley (pers. comm.) recorded Maned Wolves pursuing Hoary Foxes at Serra da Canastra National Park and south-eastern Goias, respectively. In south-eastern Goiás, 24% of the mortality in a monitored population (N = 40 Hoary Foxes) was due to predation by Pumas&#160;<em>Puma concolor </em>(Lemos 2016).","The major threats to the Hoary Fox are habitat destruction and other direct and indirect anthropogenic effects (Lemos, Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lemos <em>et al</em>. 2013, Lemos 2016). The species is endemic to the Cerrado, which was historically seen as unproductive land. However, extensive commercial and industrial development in the region over the last two decades, characterized by growth (in size and number) of urban centres, increased timber exploitation for coal provision, conversion of natural habitats to pastures and crops,&#160;and the expansion of linear structures for transportation of rural products has resulted in loss and fragmentation of the original Cerrado habitats (Dalponte 2003, Lemos and&#160;Azevedo 2009, Lemos, Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lemos <em>et al</em>. 2013). Natural Cerrado areas in São Paulo and Minas Gerais occur in small and scattered fragments, and are currently isolated from the northern, more continuous portion of the biome.<br/><br/>Road kills are responsible for a high number of individuals being lost from populations (Dalponte 2003, Dalponte and&#160;Courtenay 2004, Lemos and&#160;Azevedo, 2009, Lemos, Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lemos 2016), followed by attacks by domestic dogs and human persecution in response to an erroneous perception that Hoary Foxes attack domestic fowl (Dalponte 2003, Lemos and&#160;Azevedo 2009, Lemos, Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lemos <em>et al</em>. 2013, Bickley <em>et al.&#160;</em>in press). In fact, domestic fowl are mostly absent from the Hoary Fox diet (Lemos, Facure <em>et al</em>. 2011, Kotviski <em>et al</em>. in press). During population monitoring (n = 40 individuals) in Cumari, south-eastern Goiás, 29 Hoary Fox carcasses were retrieved, with the cause of mortality identified as: road-kills (n = 5), attacks by domestic dogs (n = 1), poisoning/gunshot (n = 3), predation by cougars (n = 7) and old age (n = 1). Mortality causes for 12 individuals were impossible to determine, but it is possible that diseases may have played a role.<br/><br/>Increasing contact between Hoary Foxes and humans and domestic animals may be leading to the development of novel eco-epidemiologic relationships as observed in Cumari (Goiás state). Hoary Foxes are frequently observed foraging among cattle and in close contact with human residences, and involved in antagonistic encounters with domestic dogs (Lemos, Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011). An infection of canine distemper virus (CDV) has been reported in a wild Hoary Fox and the potential sources of infection were domestic dogs (Megid <em>et al</em>. 2010). This report highlights the susceptibility of the species to CDV, with clinical and hystopathological signs identical to those developed by domestic dogs. There are also reports of two individuals that tested positive for canine parvovirus (Curi 2005). In the past, Hoary Foxes were identified as reservoirs of <em>Leishmania chagasi</em> (Deane and&#160;Deane 1954). However, Courtenay <em>et al.</em> (1996) compared craniums and demonstrated that infected individuals were in fact misidentified Crab-eating Foxes. There are no reports of rabies for the species. Hoary Foxes of two populations sampled in Cumari (Goiás) and Araguari (Minas Gerais) showed positive seroprevalence for <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> (71%) and <em>Leptospira </em>spp. (14.2%). However, parasites were not isolated, and there were no parasitemia cases nor clinical signs. Therefore, clinical and epidemiological importance of these parasites for Hoary Foxes is still unclear (Rocha <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2015). Consequently, long-term studies to elucidate the susceptibility of this species to pathogens and understand the effects of these parasites on the survival of populations in natural and human-modified areas across its range are urgently needed.","Only two studies have previously estimated population densities of the Hoary Fox. Rocha <em>et al</em>. (2008) used linear transects at two locations in Mato Grosso and estimated 1.21 individuals per km² in an area covered by shrub savannah and 4.28 individuals per km² in an exotic grass pasture. However, these estimates should be cautiously interpreted since it is possible that the difference in density is biased by: i) the species' detectability in the different environments, and ii) the timing of sampling in different reproductive seasons. The 4.28 density was estimated in the second semester, when foxes are known to be denning and foraging with puppies together, and this may have overestimated density at the pasture site. Rezende (2018), using capture-recapture models accounting for imperfect detectability, estimated 0.41 individual per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in a fragmented area comprising a matrix of exotic pastures in south-eastern Goiás. In the same region/population, Lemos and Azevedo (unpublished data) registered offspring mortality greater than 50% in cohorts monitored during 12 years, with potentially negative demographic impacts.<br/><br/>To estimate the population size of the Hoary Fox, the total area of suitable habitat was determined taking into account remnants of Cerrado habitats (grassland, savannah, and other non-forest), and 50% of the area of pastures, within the species’ current range, yielding an area of approximately 120,000 km². Considering the limited information on density for the species in disturbed and natural habitats (0.41 individual per km², Rezende 2018;&#160;1.21 individuals per km², Rocha <em>et al</em>. 2008), the habitats known to be used and the anthropogenic threats across most of the range, it was estimated that the Hoary Fox population might be approximately 49,200-96,000 individuals (based on a mean density of 0.8 individual per km²). Number of mature individuals may vary according to species life stories, degree of habitat specificity, mortality rates, and how isolated subpopulations are. There are no available data on the number of mature individuals among different Hoary fox subpopulations. From a monitored subpopulation of Cumari, south-eastern Goiás,&#160;not all adults were able to find a mate and breed annually, and mortality of adults and dispersing young was high. Breeding males and females represented about 20-25% of monitored individuals annually (Lemos and Azevedo, pers. obs). On the other hand, genetic data obtained from Cumari and a second subpopulation from Araguari, western Minas Gerais, suggest high genetic diversity of individuals (He = 0.816, Silva 2015), despite the high degree of human disturbance in sampled areas. On a wider phylogeographic perspective, Garcez (2019) also infers that the population of Hoary Foxes is structured in only one population along Brazil, not showing signs of isolation or fragmentation. Therefore, considering 20-25% of the population is capable of reproducing,&#160;the high mortality rates of adults and dispersing young, and the low densities registered, the number of mature individuals is estimated to range between 9,840 and 19,200 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Considering the joint impacts of ongoing loss of habitat, road-kills, persecution, killing and transmission of diseases by domestic dogs, retaliation for the alleged predation of domestic fowl, high mortality of pups/juveniles in different populations along unprotected areas, and that this is common throughout the species distribution, it is not unreasonable to estimate that in 12 years (three generations) a decline of at least 10% of the population could occur.","Decreasing"

The holotype was collected from a farm close to a nature reserve, and the known localities lie within the Cerrado (Sawaya <em>et al.</em> 2008) The known localities are characterized by ""mosaics of open Cerrado vegetation"", and particularly areas with mesic climates, pronounced dry seasons and deep sandy soils known as campo sucio (known in Brazil as campo sujo - C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2019) (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 2018). It has been hypothesized that this species may be specialized to this microhabitat, which may explain its apparent rarity and patchy distribution as this habitat type has a ""sparse distribution"" (Atkinson <em>et al. </em>2018).","There is ongoing and extensive habitat loss within this region due to cattle farming, agricultural, and urban expansion. Data from 2008 indicated that as little as 22.7% of the area within a 10 km<sup>2</sup> buffer of the known localities was still covered by native vegetation (PMDBBS 2012), however, this species may be extremely localized and savanna habitat within its apparent range is restricted to small fragments (C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2019). Flat grassland areas such as campo sucio are are often among the first to be converted to mechanized agriculture, and the small areas that remain are mostly ""in poor shape"" (C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2019). Atkinson<em> et al.</em> (2018) state that the total area of campo siucio habitat is ""tiny"" (estimating that it is below 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>) This value appears to have been based on the IUCN thresholds, and the true area of campo sucio is believed to be well below this value - C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2019). The area around the type locality, including the Itirapina reserve, is only around 1,300 ha and this species seems to be localized even within this area; most other patches of this habitat are smaller (C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2019). The species may consequently be at risk from the rapid conversion of these areas for agricultural use. The Rancho Laguna Blanca lies within one of the most desirable areas of Paraguay for agricultural development, and while this site was formerly a private reserve this protection expired in 2015 and Atkinson <em>et al.</em> (2018) reported that it was up for sale, with a high risk that it could soon be converted to ranchland.","This species is to date is known from four specimens collected from three localities and at intervals of nearly or more than 30 years: in 1952, 1980, and 2016 (Atkinson<em> et al.</em> 2018). It has never been rediscovered at either Elba farm or Rio Brilhante, despite&#160;extensive sampling using multiple approaches in remaining Cerrado in the Estação Ecológica de Itirapina, adjacent to Elba farm (Sawaya<em> et al.</em> 2008), and it was not recorded until 2016 at the Paraguayan locality, where reptile surveys have been ongoing since 2010 (Atkinson <em>et al. </em>2018). This suggests that this is an extremely rare species or restricted to particular, discontinuous habitats (Sawaya<em> et al.</em> 2008), or at least that it is difficult to detect using standard survey methods (Atkinson <em>et al. </em>2018). This latter is considered unlikely, as other <em>Phalotris </em>species were found in the reserve during these surveys (C. Nogueira pers. comm. 2019). The population trend is unknown, but due to pressures on the Cerrado and the likelihood that this species is endemic to this habitat, it is very likely to be declining (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 2018). This species appears to occur at very low densities and apparently suitable habitat is sporadically distributed (Atkinson <em>et al</em>. 2018), and as such it may well occur as a severely fragmented population.","Unknown"

"Asthenes luizae","Near Threatened",2020,"2020-07-22 00:00:00 UTC","Cipo Canastero is restricted to&#160;<em>campo rupestre:</em>&#160;isolated rocky outcrops with dry, bushy vegetation. It ranges from 1,100 to 2,000 m (Freitas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019a, b) and prefers steep, well vegetated slopes. The diet consists of invertebrates taken from rocks, crevices and  shrubs. Pairs have been recorded holding territory in July and August,  and observed with dependent young in December. Nests are situated in areas with rocky outcrops and are placed on a variety of plants, including grass, bromeliads, shrubs and trees, or directly on the ground (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><p></p>","Brood parasitism by the recently introduced Shiny Cowbird (<em>Molothrus bonariensis</em>) is thought to be the most serious current threat and the main cause of the species's ongoing decline (Costa 2015). A study of breeding success in <em>A. luizae&#160;</em>found that&#160;<em>M. bonariensis</em>&#160;parasitism was the biggest cause of nest failure (Costa 2011, 2015).<br/><br/>Fires potentially pose a serious threat to the species (L. E. Lopes<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2009, Vasconceles 2009, Costa 2015). Fires are largely used to renew the grassland vegetation for use as natural pastures&#160; and may also be caused by conflict between people and protected areas, as well as by lightning (Ribeiro and Figueira 2011). Although the <em>campos rupestres</em>&#160;is adapted to fire, anthropogenic changes in the fire regime increase the frequency and intensity of fires, reducing the ability of the ecosytem to recover (Figueira <em>et al. </em>2016). Fires are more frequent in the dry season, which coincides with the Cipo Canastero's breeding season (Costa 2015).&#160;An analysis of fire history in the Serrado Cipo National Park and Morroda Pedreira Environment Protection Area found that 75% of the study area had been burned at least once between 1984 and 2014, and 48% of the area was burned every 1-2 years (Alvarado <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). In some years, the total burned area was more than 300 km2 (Alvarado <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). However, fires in the Serrado Cipo National Park do not usually burn more than a hectare (Figueira <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/>Small numbers of cattle are scattered along the Espinhaço mountains, but  they are not present on the steep slopes or rocky areas (M. F. de  Vasconcelos<em> in litt.</em> 2009). Incursion of invasive grasses may be reducing the quality of the species's habitat (Freitas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019b). The construction of a new road destroyed some habitat at the type locality.&#160;Development for tourism and infrastructure continues to pose a threat, as does mineral extraction within the Espinhaço Range.&#160;More than 40% of the species's habitat is currently either directly or indirectly affected by mining (Pena&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><p></p>Climate change is likely to pose a significant threat in future decades. A model of the impact of climate on the potential range of rupestrian grassland in the Espinhaço Range&#160;predicted that around half would be lost by 2080 (Bitencourt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Other models indicated that rupestrian grasslands might lose up to 95% of their current suitable area by the end of the century (Wilson Fernandes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).","When discovered, the species was described as 'not uncommon in a small area at Serra do Cipo, Minas Gerais' (Pearman 1990). The species seems to be more abundant in the northern part of its range, especially in the Diamantina plateau and central Espinhaço in central-northern Minas Gerais state (M. F. de Vasconcelos<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>The species has a strongly male-biased sex ratio (Freitas 2011, Costa 2015), with an adult population composed of c.70% males (Costa 2015, Freitas <em>et al.</em>2019). As a result, a low proportion of the adult population (47%) are in breeding pairs (Costa 2015).<br/><br/>Surveys in 2009-2010 in Serra do Cipó&#160;found a mean population density of 29 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in&#160;<em>campo rupestre</em>&#160;habitat,&#160;and 13 individuals, and five breeding pairs, per km<sup>2</sup> across the study area (Freitas 2011). Another analysis of surveys at Serra do Cipó&#160;provided mean population densities of 35.2 adult individuals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in&#160;<em>campo rupestre</em>&#160;habitat,&#160;and 13.6 adults per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;across the study area&#160;(Freitas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019a). Considering paired individuals only, this study found an average of 22.9 per km<sup>2</sup> in&#160;<em>campo rupestre</em>&#160;habitat,&#160;and 8.7 per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;across the study area&#160;(Freitas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019a). Surveys from 2009-2015 in Serra do Cipó&#160;found an average density of&#160;17 adult individuals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of rocky outcrops, and 8 adults per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of study area, with a lower density of paired individuals (7 and 3 respectively) due to the sex ratio bias (Costa 2015). Based on the area of habitat within the species's range, the species' global population size was projected to be around 21,800 (7,400 - 47,600) paired individuals (Costa 2015).<br/><br/>Updated estimates of the area of suitable habitat were derived from a species distribution model by Freitas <em>et al. </em>(2019b). By multiplying average numbers of paired individuals found by Costa (2015) by the new estimated area of habitat, the population size was estimated at 12,792 (3,655-29,238;&#160;L. M. Costa and G. H. S. Freitas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). By removing some area of the modelled range polygons without nearby records, a more conservative version of the modelled range was produced, which represented 83% of the original area. Multiplying the above population estimated by 83% produced a more conservative population estimate of 10,617 (3,034-24,268).<p></p>Based on the estimates described, the population size is here placed in the band 3,000 - 48,000 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 10,600.<br/><br/>The species's range is divided into three areas separated by some distance and there are at least three subpopulations. L. M. Costa (2015) estimated 700 mature individuals in the northern part of the range, 1,900 in the central part and 19,800 in the southern part. However, it is likely that there are further subpopulation divisions within these blocks, particularly the southern block, due to narrower gaps of around 10 km between areas of suitable elevation. The species is thought to have a low dispersal distance (Costa 2015). A study of the species's habitat and elevational range identified nine 'sky islands' within the species's range, which may represent separate subpopulations (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2019b). By multiplying the area of each ‘sky island’ by the proportion of each sky island that falls within the species distribution model (from Table 1 in Freitas <em>et al. </em>2019b) to find the area of the distribution model in each, then dividing the population estimate between the sky islands according to their relative area of species distribution model, the largest sky island (Cipó North) is estimated to hold 974-15,287 mature individuals (here rounded to 900-16,000), with a best estimate of 3,404 (here rounded to 3,000).","Decreasing"

Strüssmann pers. comm. 2021).","The species' habitat, grassland formations in the Cerrado (e.g. rocky field and open cerrados), has been drastically reduced and fragmented over the past 35 years. The major threats to this species are habitat loss and degradation, caused mainly by the conversion of natural areas to agricultural land and pasture, the use of fire for agricultural management, and disturbance from tourism (even within protected areas), and pollution of breeding habitats (Brandão<em> et al.</em> 2009, Haddad <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>In some areas there are mining activities and soy plantations. The Mineiros region is very fragmented. One of the known localities, in the region of the mouth of Corrego Palmeira, a tributary on the right bank of the Manso River, was flooded by the reservoir of the Manso Hydroelectric Power Plant, causing its local extinction (C.

The habitat throughout its geographical distribution has been fragmented.&#160;Connection between subpopulations has been lost due to the severe fragmentation of natural habitats. Each subpopulation has a specific genetic variant, with very low genetic diversity, with no intrapopulation diversity (probably there is little or no gene flow between them) (R.

Feeds individually, in pairs, or in small family groups on a variety of invertebrate prey (Olmos <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). Forages in thick vegetation but occasionally pursues flushed prey in flight (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2003). Breeds from May to July (Crozariol 2011).","Its specialised habitat requirements make the species susceptible to changes in hydrological management. The greatest threat to the species is the development of hydroelectrocity projects (HPP), which are likely to flood large parts of the species's habitat (Brasil Choueri&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Dornas and Pinheira 2018, D. Lima&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). The Estreito Hydro-Power Complex was recently constructed in the Tocantins-Araguaia river basin and within the species's range (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020), going into operation in 2012. The reservoir of this project reaches between Estreito (Maranhão) and Palmeirante (Tocantins; Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). Two hydroelectrical plants projects are currently in progress within the species's range: HPP Marabá (Pará) and HPP Santa Isabel&#160;(Tocantins). HPP Marabá is projected to produce a reservoir that will reach the dam of HPP Santa Isabel on the Araguai River, and HPP Serra Quebrada in Itaguatins (PAC 2018). HPP Santa Isabel is planned for the region of the Rapids of Santa Isabel, and the reservoir is projected to reach&#160;Araguanã (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). There are plans to construct two further hydroelectrical plants (HPP) within the species's range by 2025: HPP Araguanã and HPP Serra Quebrada, both in Tocantins, but the plans are currently on hold and they are not expected to be constructed within the next 5-10 years (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;HPP Araguanã is projected to create a reservoir that will come close to&#160;Araguacema, and HPP Serra Quebrada will dam&#160; the Tocantins river, with a reservoir reaching HPP Estreito (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018).

Based on the recorded population densities, the area of tree cover with 50% canopy cover within within the species's mapped range (estimated at 46,600 km<sup>2</sup>; Global Forest Watch 2020), and assuming 10-25% of the forest is occupied, the population is estimated at&#160;195,720-489,300&#160;individuals, roughly equating to&#160;130,480&#160;- 326,200 mature individuals. Based on these estimates, the population size is here placed in the band 15,000 - 350,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>There are no large gaps between areas with records and the species is considered to have a relatively high dispersal ability (Borges <em>et al. </em>2019), so it is assumed to have one subpopulation.","Decreasing"

Climate change may lead to further habitat loss (Borges <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019); an analysis projected that the species may lose 69-80% of its 1990 distribution by 2099 as a result of climate change (Marini <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).<strong></strong><p></p>","The species has been considered rare and in general there are few visual records, with records made most frequently in the Pantanal and in the&#160;Cantão State Park, Tocantins (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). In Cantão State Park, an average abundance of 0.12 - 0.38 individuals per kilometre of river was estimated (Dornas and Pinheiro 2007). In the Paranã river valley on the border of Goiás and Tocantins, a relative abundance of c.40 individuals per 100 hours of sampling was calculated (Pacheco and Olmos 2006).<br/><br/>The population size has not been estimated directly. Based on a population density of 0.12 - 0.38 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>, an estimated area of forest habitat with at least 50% canopy cover of 143,600 km<sup>2</sup> in 2020 (Global Forest Watch 2021), and assuming 10-40% of habitat within its mapped range is occupied, the population size is tentatively suspected to be within the range 1,723-21,827 individuals. This is assumed to roughly equate to 1,149-14,551 mature individuals, here rounded to 1,000 - 15,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The Brazilian Red List considers that the species has three subpopulations (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018).","Decreasing"
"Thylamys velutinus","Near Threatened",2021,"2016-02-22 00:00:00 UTC","<p><span lang=""en-US"">The species occurs in open habitats <span lang=""en-US"">within<span lang=""en-US""> the Cerrado biome (Carmignotto and Monfort 2006). It was recorded in areas of arboreal dense savanna, grassy and shrubby vegetation (Vieira and Palma 1996, Bonvicino <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2003, Carmignotto and Monfort 2006). This species appears to be nocturnal and insectivorous-omnivorous, and 75% of its diet is of animal origin, including 44% arthropods. Home ranges based on recaptures were estimated at 2.3 ha for a male and 1.7 ha for a female (Vieira and Palma 1996). Unlike other mouse opossums, <em><span lang=""en-US"">Thylamys</em><span lang=""en-US""> are found in the central and southern part of South America in dry habitats, as opposed to the more mesic environments of other genera (Palma <em><span lang=""en-US"">et al</span></em><span lang=""en-US"">. 2002, <span lang=""en-US"">Martin 2009, Giarla and Jansa 2014<span lang=""en-US"">).

However, <span lang=""en-US""><em>T. velutinus </em><span lang=""en-US"">and <span lang=""en-US""><em>T. karimii</em><span lang=""en-US""> - the species from Brazil - are mostly terrestrial, and the only ones to have a tail length less than head and body length, a lack of prehensile tail tip, small feet and long claws (Carmignotto and Monfort 2006, Giarla <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2010).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","There is intense habitat destruction (replacement of native vegetation for crops, mainly soybean plantations) over much of its range and the recent records are all from Conservation Units.","It appears to be locally rare over its distributional range (Vieira pers. comm., Carmignotto and Monfort 2006). The records from São Paulo and Minas Gerais states are very old, the most recent from 1960 (more than 50 years ago); recent records (during the last 20 years) exist only for Distrito Federal and Goiás states (Tate 1933, Vieira and Palma 1996, Bonvicino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Carmignotto and Monfort 2006).

"Pyrrhura pfrimeri","Endangered",2021,"2021-03-19 00:00:00 UTC","It is restricted to deciduous or semi-deciduous dry forest growing on limestone outcrops or limestone derived soils. This <em>caatinga</em> type habitat is an isolated island within surrounding <em>cerrado</em> savannah, pasture and agricultural lands. Dry forest typically has a closed canopy and dense understorey with lianas and some cacti, particularly in disturbed areas. The species has been seen in degraded and fragmented forest patches (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997). It leaves forest to feed in rice fields, on planted fruits such as mangoes and guava, and on seeds in degraded areas such as abandoned pastures and road verges (Bianchi 2010, Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). It does not&#160;usually venture more than 300 m outside forest with limestone outcrops (Bianchi 2010), although a small flock has been recorded 1.5 km from the nearest forest with limestone outcrops (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). It feeds on flowers, fruits and seeds, sometimes on the ground and typically in groups.&#160;It also consumes minerals obtained from the rocky walls of the limestone outcrops or from the banks of small rivers and streams (Dornas <em>et al. </em>2016). It breeds between October and January (Bianchi 2008).<p></p>","The principal threat to this species is deforestation driven by selective logging, fires and habitat conversion to pasture or soybean plantations (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997; Bianchi 2008). Dry forest in Goiás decreased in extent from 15.8 % of the state in 1990 to only 5.8 % in 1999, and less than 1 % of the remaining fragments were larger than 100 ha<strong>&#160;</strong>(Andahur 2001). As the area of remaining forest has decreased, the rate of conversion to pasture and plantations has lessened, but selective logging continues to degrade and remove remaining forest (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Logging mainly targets durable woods that include most of the species's native foodplants, for use as fence poles and for improvements to farms (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). It is likely that logging reduces the availability of hollow trees for nesting (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Cement companies are beginning to target areas of limestone outcrops<strong>&#160;</strong>(C. A. Bianchi&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006). Small areas of forest are flooded as the result of the construction of small hydroelectric power plants (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). Future hydroelectric plant developments in tributaries such as the Inferno and&#160;São Domingos rivers could potentially flood thousands of hectares of remaining habitat (T. Dornas, <em>pers. comm</em>., in Dornas and Pinheiro 2018; T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Recently, small scale sugarcane and soybean plantations are replacing old pastures in some areas in the surroundings of Terra Ronca State Park, the only conservation unit with significant size within the species’s range (T. Dornas <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>The species is rarely recorded in trade or exotic bird collections but this poses a potential threat (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997). The species is sometimes shot when foraging in rice and corn fields (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018).<p></p>The species may be at risk from habitat alteration as a result of climate change (Borges <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).","It is locally common within its restricted range (Olmos <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). <br/><br/>Surveys in 1995 recorded individuals at a density of 198 per km<sup>2</sup> in larger blocks of dry forest (considered likely to be an overestimate due to an uneven distribution of a food plant), 23 per km<sup>2</sup> in isolated fragments of forest, and 60-75 per km<sup>2</sup> across the whole of the Nova Roma area (thought to be a more accurate estimate; Olmos <em>et al. </em>1997). Based on an estimated remaining area of forest in 1995 of c.2,700 km<sup>2</sup> and a population density of 60-75 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>, the population size was estimated at 162,000 - 202,500 individuals, although it was noted that this may have been an overestimate because the area where surveys took place may have contained more remaining habitat than other parts of the species's range (Olmos <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997).<br/><br/>Surveys across the species's range in 2007-2008 estimated the density to be 11.7 (9-15) individuals per km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Bianchi 2010). Based on an estimated area of remaining forest of&#160;4,352 km<sup>2</sup>, the population size was estimated at&#160;39,168–65,280 individuals (Bianchi 2010).<br/><br/>In 2020, the population was suspected to fall in the range of 20,000 - 25,000 individuals (T. Dornas <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). According to remote sensing data on tree cover and tree cover loss, there may be approximately 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> of tree cover with at least 50% canopy cover remaining within the species's range in 2021 (Global Forest Watch 2021). Based on the population density estimates from 2007-2008 (9-15 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>), the population size in 2021 is here estimated to fall within the range 18,000 - 30,000 individuals, roughly equating to 12,000 - 20,000 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 16,000.<br/><br/>The subpopulation structure is not known. The species generally stays within 300 m of forest with limestone outcrops (Bianchi 2010), although it has been recorded up to 1.5 km away (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018), so it is able to travel at least short distances between patches of forest.","Decreasing"
"Knipolegus franciscanus","Least Concern",2021,"2021-07-16 00:00:00 UTC","It occurs in well-preserved <em>caatinga</em>&#160;dry forest patches, usually associated with limestone or sandstone outcrops (except at the São Tomé locality). It has also been recorded in gallery forest and in shrubby vegetation on rocky outcrops (Lima 1999, Vasconcelos and D'Angelo Neto 2018). Seasonal movements to forested areas away from rocky outcrops have been noted outside the breeding season (J. F. Pacheco&#160;<em>per</em>&#160;F. Olmos&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2004; de Vasconcelos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). It is occasionally found near habitation (Kirwan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). It is able to persist in degraded habitats, and may be found in pasture adjacent to dry forests (da Silva and Oren 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).","Limestone-derived soils are the most fertile in the region, so clearance for pasture and irrigated cultures has been widespread. The destruction of dry forest has been extensive since the early 1960s (T. Dornas <em>in litt. </em>2013). Around São Felix do Coribe in western Bahia, remaining dry forest patches are very small (all areas less than 200 ha) and this is the case throughout the limestone region. Remaining forest is exploited for timber, mostly for fence poles (<strong></strong>Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997<strong></strong>). Satellite imagery from the Paranã valley in Goiás has shown that dry forests declined from 15.8% of the region in 1990 to only 5.4% in 1999, and less than 1% of the remaining fragments are over 100 ha, although they make up 48% of the remaining forest (Andahur 2001)<strong></strong>. Most of the remaining forest is associated with rocky outcrops where cultivation or pastures are not viable, and vegetation composition there differs to that of forest on flatter ground. <span id=""result_box"" class="""" lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps""><span class=""hps"">There  are intentions by mining companies to explore the potential  extraction of agricultural products from limestone outcrops in the  future (T.

it inconspicuous in denser forests, so it may be more common than records suggest (Kirwan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). The species was found to be common during surveys at Jequitaí, Minas Gerais (Vasconcelos and D'Angelo Neto 2018), but the species has not been detected with such frequency elsewhere.

However, the semi-nomadism of the species suggests that it depends on unpredictable food resources. Breeding takes place between May and October in Emas National Park (Bianchi 2009).<p></p>","By 1993, two-thirds of the Cerrado region had been either heavily or moderately altered, with most of the destruction having occurred since 1950<strong> </strong>(Cavalcanti 1999, Conservation International 1999). High-quality <em>cerrado habitats </em>are being rapidly destroyed by mechanised agriculture, intensive cattle-ranching, afforestation, invasive grasses, excessive use of pesticides and annual burning (<strong></strong>Stotz <em>et al</em>. 1996, Parker and Willis 1997, Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2017). <em>Caatinga </em>habitats are less threatened, but still suffer conversion to agriculture, grazing and burning.<br/>The species is moreover threatened by trapping for the cage-bird trade (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><p></p>","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as uncommon to locally common (Sick 1993, Stotz <em>et al</em>. 1996).","Decreasing"
